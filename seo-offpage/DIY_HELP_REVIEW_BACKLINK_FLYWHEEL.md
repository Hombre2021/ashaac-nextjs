# DIY Help Center Review + Backlink Flywheel

Use this playbook when the DIY Help Center relaunches with videos and remote guidance.

Goal:
- Build national informational visibility with helpful DIY content
- Generate more Google reviews from real support interactions
- Earn relevant backlinks by promoting useful resources

## 1) On-page blocks to add on DIY pages

### A. National education + local service boundary
Use this near the top of each DIY page:

> Educational HVAC videos and remote guidance are available nationwide. In-person HVAC service is currently available in Salt Lake County and surrounding areas.

### B. "Was this helpful?" review CTA
Place after the main solution steps and near the page footer:

**Header:** Helped by this guide?

**Copy:** If this DIY guide or remote support helped you, we’d truly appreciate your honest review on Google.

**Button label:** Leave a Google Review

### C. "Share this guide" backlink CTA
Place below the review CTA:

**Header:** Share this guide

**Copy:** If this resource helped your audience, feel free to link to it from your website, newsletter, or community post.

**Button label:** Copy Page Link

### D. Live help request block
Add this as a conversion section:

**Header:** Need live help?

**Copy:** Send your issue details and we’ll follow up with remote troubleshooting options.

**Fields:** Name, Email, Phone, City/State, Issue summary, Best time to reach

## 2) Review request templates (policy-safe)

Only send these after a real interaction.

### SMS template (after DIY or live support)

### Email template (same day)

## 3) Backlink outreach templates for DIY resources

## 4) Weekly operating cadence (45-60 min)

1. Publish or update one DIY resource page
2. Send 5 review requests to recent real interactions
3. Send 5 backlink/resource outreach emails
4. Log outcomes in trackers

## 5) Tracking fields to log weekly

- Resource URL
- Date published/updated
- Review requests sent
- Reviews received
- Outreach sent
- Backlinks earned
- Referral traffic (if available)

## 6) Compliance guardrails

- Do not offer incentives for positive reviews
- Ask for honest reviews only
- Do not buy links or use spam directories
- Keep on-page claims clear: nationwide education, local in-person service

## 7) Implementation checklist before DIY relaunch

- Add review CTA component on DIY pages
- Add share/link CTA component on DIY pages
- Add live-help lead form workflow
- Add VideoObject/FAQ schema for each guide
- Prepare review link and outreach snippets for team use
