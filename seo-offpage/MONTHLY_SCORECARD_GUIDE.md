## Monthly operating rhythm

1. Update all numeric fields by the 1st business day.
2. Record top wins and blockers in `Wins` and `Issues`.
3. Define one clear `Next_Month_Focus` (example: "West Jordan furnace install page + 20 local outreach emails/week").
4. Keep previous months unchanged after close for trend reliability.

## Suggested targets (adjust over time)

- GBP posts: 8+ per month
- Outreach emails: 80+ per month
- Review responses SLA: 24–48h
- Citation progress: 5–10 verified listings per month until baseline is complete
