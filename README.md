All pages built. I am in the last details and completing all links. Not quite ready for migration but close. Added Google and BBB verification images, updated Hero man with All Solutions HVAC uniform, increased titles and subtitles size and theme. Once all visuals and links are done, then I will focus on SEO, back links and maintaining whatever status I have to make it better, this website will be faster, better, and more efficient.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Default local startup workflow: run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ..\dev.ps1` from the workspace root (`my-hvac-website`) for the most stable dev environment on Windows.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
